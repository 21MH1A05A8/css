	<p>Decades of conflict and the breakdown of local institutions has meant that traditional community-level natural resource management systems have been lost. Conflict has also caused countless families to flee their homes and move across the country in search of safety. This has led to unclear ownership rights and the unequal and unsustainable use of shared resources, and even the usurpation of previously forested common land for private crop cultivation and the illegal timber trade, which has flourished as part of the war economy. The ongoing conflict has also meant that environmental issues and preparing for climate change has taken a backseat in the country.</p>

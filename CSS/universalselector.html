<h1>hello</h1>

<p> Our mission is to build sustainable communities, whilst leaving an ecological footprint that is as small as possible. A big part of this is planting and replanting trees..what drought-resistant crops to grow and how best to do this; how to successfully cultivate saplings and care for orchards; and bio-briquette making. Protecting against natural disasters We will also strengthen the resilience of local families to natural disasters like floods, landslides and drought. We will teach them how to identify the risks in their area, and build their capacity to protect themselves, their land and of course, their trees. Taking an inclusive approach In order to ensure the whole community is involved, we will target particularly vulnerable individuals and families, including female-headed households, people with disabilities, and the unemployed youth. For example, we will support vulnerable women to establish and manage community sapling nurseries. This provides them with a vital source of income, as well as skills they can use in the future, whilst supporting reforestation efforts in their local area. Similarly, we will also support vulnerable women to establish their own kitchen gardens. The women will be provided with all the equipment and seeds they need to get going, and the support they need along the way to make sure their nurseries or gardens flourish. Communities take the lead on reforestation By supporting community members to work together to identify</p>
